            <h1>Quotes</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Don't worry if it doesn't work right.If everything did, you'd be out of a job.</li>
                <li> Don't comment bad code - rewrite it. - Brian Kernighan</li>
                <li>A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing programs you've already
                    thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen. - Paul Graham</li>
                <li>Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging
                    Monday's code. - Dan Salomon</li>
                <li>ItÂ´s better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait for the first
                    available programmer to become productive. - Steve McConnell</li>
            </ul>
