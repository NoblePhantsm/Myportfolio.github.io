It is also one of the largest known stars with an estimated radius over 1,000 times that of the sun, and were it placed in the Sun's position it would reach between the orbit of Jupiter and Saturn.</p></td>

It is distinctly reddish, and is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0.0 and 1.3, the widest range of any first-magnitude star.</p></td>

Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri) is a type K5 giant star in the constellation Taurus that is frequently featured in works of science fiction. There have been claims by astronomers using radial velocity measurements that Aldebaran hosts a planetary system with at least one substellar companion, but none of these has been confirmed as of 2013. Aldebaran is a popular subject for ancient myths in multiple cultures (Inuit, Mexican, Native American) and, in more recent times, the mythologizing of science fiction</p></td>
